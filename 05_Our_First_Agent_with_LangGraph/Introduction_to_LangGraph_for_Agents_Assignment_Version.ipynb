        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

So if the model is Open AI, it would bind these tools using Open AI function calling as described in this document: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?api-mode=responses. If we are dealing with a different provider, lang chain would follow the docs in that provider. More generally, you are telling an LLM which tools it could use and then asking it to decide whether or not it should instruct you to invoke those tools"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

It works by adding low-rank matrices to the original, frozen model, which contain new weights that modify the model's outputs without retraining the entire model. This approach significantly reduces training time and computational resources, making it easier to fine-tune large models for specialized applications. LoRA is particularly useful for accelerating training and reducing memory usage in large language models.\\n\\n2. **Tim Dettmers**: Tim Dettmers is a researcher and assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as a research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI. His work focuses on making foundation models like ChatGPT more accessible by reducing their resource requirements.

            "Fine-tuning is a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is further trained on a specific dataset to adapt it to a particular task or domain. This approach leverages the knowledge the model has already acquired during its initial training on large, general datasets, and then refines it to perform better on specialized tasks. Fine-tuning typically involves adjusting the model's weights slightly, allowing it to better capture the nuances of the new data without starting the training process from scratch.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fine-tuning became prominent with the rise of large pre-trained models, especially in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. Its popularity surged around the mid-2010s, particularly with the advent of models like BERT (introduced in 2018) and GPT (with GPT-2 in 2019 and GPT-3 in 2020). These models demonstrated that starting with a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for specific tasks could achieve state-of-the-art performance with less data and computational resources compared to training models from scratch.\n",

            "LLM-based agents are intelligent systems that leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform a variety of tasks, such as understanding natural language, generating human-like responses, and making decisions or taking actions based on the input they receive. These agents can be used in applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, automated customer support, and more complex decision-making systems.\n",
